# Michael's Pad

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/michaelyfan/michael-pad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/michaelyfan/michael-pad)

I wanted a mobile-responsive site to take notes while playing video games, and certain existing solutions kept failing on me. Mainly for use on my phone, and on Steam's in-game browser.

Will be written in vanilla JavaScript and served statically. In a shocking break from tradition I will be using _no framworks_.

### TODOS
* find a way to style Quill toolbar buttons
* data backup button or automatic backup
* use SASS, but please have this bundle automatically during development
* webpack config should handle CSS -- this responsibility should not be the js files' (opinionated)
* on a pad page, scroll down all the way, then click sign out--overlay error

### For kicks
* Migrate to Typescript
* game pictures
