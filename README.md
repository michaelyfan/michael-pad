I wanted a place to take notes while playing video games, and certain existing solutions kept failing on me

Will be written in vanilla JavaScript and served statically. In a shocking break from tradition I will be using _no framworks_.

## TODOS
* 404 page
* game pictures
* password attempt lockout
* use something besides default alert
* ability to reorder game list
* consider importing font awesome as a JS module to reduce load times
* find a way to style Quill toolbar buttons
